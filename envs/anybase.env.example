# Anybase Integration Configuration Example
# Copy this file to .env and modify the values according to your setup

# Enable Anybase integration
ANYBASE_ENABLED=true

# Anybase API base URL (without trailing slash)
ANYBASE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-anybase-domain.com

# Anybase login page URL for redirect when user is not authenticated
ANYBASE_LOGIN_URL=https://your-anybase-domain.com/login

# Example usage:
# 1. Set these environment variables in your .env file
# 2. When a user from Anybase accesses ApeRAG with their token in Authorization header,
#    ApeRAG will automatically verify the token with Anybase, create/sync the user,
#    and set an ApeRAG session cookie for future requests
# 3. If a user accesses ApeRAG without authentication and Anybase is enabled,
#    the response will include X-Anybase-Login-URL header suggesting redirect to Anybase login

# Integration Flow:
# 1. User logs in to Anybase and gets a token
# 2. Anybase redirects user to ApeRAG with the token in Authorization header
# 3. ApeRAG calls Anybase /api/v1/user/me to verify token and get user info
# 4. If user doesn't exist in ApeRAG, automatically create account
# 5. Set ApeRAG session cookie for future requests
# 6. User can now use ApeRAG with seamless authentication
